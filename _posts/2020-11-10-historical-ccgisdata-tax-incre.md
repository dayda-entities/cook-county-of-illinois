TIF District boundaries. TIF districts receive money from property taxes by utilizing increases in the value of properties located in the TIF. There is no tax rate for TIF districts. Instead, TIFs receive money based on tax rates generated by other districtsâ€™ tax levies. Money is allocated to the TIF based on the composite tax rate for properties in the TIF and the incremental value of properties in that TIF (when compared to values when the TIF was established.)
