In response to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and its anticipated effects on the residential real estate market, the Cook County Assessor will adjust residential assessments. This data can be used to replicate residential COVID adjustments. Code can be located on GitLab. See data notes for link. NOTE that the 'adjusted values' in this data will not necessarily be consistent with each individual PIN's final assessment. To get the final assessment for an individual PIN, please visit www.cookcountyassessor.com.
