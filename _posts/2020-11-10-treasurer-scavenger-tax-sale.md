The biennial Scavenger Sale (conducted in odd-numbered years) offers taxes on properties that have delinquencies on three or more years that were not purchased at an Annual Tax Sale. In Cook County, the sale has traditionally taken place in the fall or early winter months.For more information on Scavenger Sales see http://www.cookcountytreasurer.com/scavengersale.aspx
