The Independent Inspector General is authorized to issue public statements in two circumstances: When an investigation that exonerates an individual who is publicly known to have been under investigation, where the subject requests such a statement; and when an investigation concerns inefficient or wasteful management, as opposed to individual misconduct or illegality.
