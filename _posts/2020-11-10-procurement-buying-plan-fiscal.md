As a public agency, the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer welcomes all vendors to participate in the open and competitive process. The buying plan contains hundreds of great opportunities for vendors to do business with Cook County. The buying plan includes information on numerous County projects and needs. You will find useful information on the department requesting proposals, project descriptions, value of contract, advertising date, and various Minority, Women and Veteran Business Enterprise subcontracting opportunities. OCPO encourages all potential vendors to use the information provided in the plan to assist them in future procurement efforts. Please contact Procurement staff or visit our website at https://www.cookcountyil.gov/procurement with any questions regarding procurement and contracting.
