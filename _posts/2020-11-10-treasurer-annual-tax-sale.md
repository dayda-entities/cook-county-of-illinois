Under Illinois law, the Treasurerâ€™s Office is required to hold an Annual Tax Sale. The sale is held once a year, sometime after the Second Installment. If property taxes for the immediately preceding tax year are delinquent on a parcel, they are offered for sale to tax purchasers at the Annual Tax Sale. The buyer is buying a tax lien on the property not the property itself.
