Employee payroll data for all Cook County employees excluding Forest Preserves, indicating amount of base salary paid to an employee during the County fiscal quarter. Salaries are paid to employees on a bi-weekly basis. 
Any pay period that extended between quarters will be reported to the quarter of the Pay Period End Date.  (e.g. If a Pay Period runs 02/21-03/05, that pay period would be reported in the Q2 period, as the end of the pay period falls in March - Q2)

The county fiscal quarters are:
Q1: December - February
Q2: March - May
Q3: June - August
Q4: September - November

The Employee Unique Identifier field is a unique number assigned to each employee for the purpose of this data set, that is not their internal employee ID number, and allows an employee to be identified in the data set over time, in case of a name change or other change. This number will be consistent within the data set, but we reserve the right to regenerate this number over time across the data set.

ISSUE RESOLVED: As of 4/19/2018 there was an issue regarding employee FY2016 and FY2017 payroll in which records were duplicated in the quarterly aggregation, resulting in inflated base pay amounts. Please disregard any data extracted from this dataset prior to the correction date and use this version moving forward. 

KNOWN ISSUE: Several records are missing Bureau and Office information. We are working on correcting this and will update the dataset when this issue has been resolved.
