Sum of Length is an internal calculation used to produce the Average Case Length in a specific offense category. Neither should be read to be associated with any individual case. Rather, the Sum of Length is the number of days in total spent on all the cases in which defendants were charged in a specific charge category combined. The Average Case Length in a particular charge category is then derived by dividing the Sum of Length by the number of defendants.
