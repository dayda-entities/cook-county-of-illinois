The Independent Inspector General submits a Quarterly Report to the President and the County Board. The Quarterly Report is released the 15th day of January, April, July, and October of each year. Quarterly Reports chronicle the number and type of investigations initiated, concluded or pending since the date of the last report. The Quarterly Report identifies the number and type of investigations (corruption, fraud, waste, mismanagement, unlawful political discrimination or misconduct) of any County employee, appointed officials, elected officials, contractors, subcontractors, persons seeking County Contracts, or persons seeking certification of eligibility for County contracts or other County Programs. The Quarterly Report identifies the number and type of investigations conducted by the OIIG regarding employees under the separately elected officials. The Quarterly Report identifies the number and type of recommendations made to any department heads or elected officials and whether or not the recommendation was followed.
