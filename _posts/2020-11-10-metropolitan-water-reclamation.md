The Independent Inspector General submits Quarterly Reports to the MWRD Board of Commissioners and Executive Director. The Quarterly Report is released the 15th day of January, April, July, and October of each year. Quarterly Reports chronicle the number and type of investigations initiated, concluded or pending since the date of the last report and whether any recommendations for remedial action were made and whether or not the recommendations were followed by the MWRD.
