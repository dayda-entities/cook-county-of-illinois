Neighborhoods play an important role in residential property assessment. Single-family and residential multi-family property assessments are sensitive to neighborhood boundaries. Neighborhoods are nearly always used in statistical regression models to produce initial assessed values, and comparable properties are nearly always selected from within neighborhoods for the purposes of appeal. See data notes for additional information.
