The County has prepared the CAFR in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). GAAP require that management provide a  narrative introduction, overview and analysis to accompany the basic financial statements in the form of a Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A). The letter of transmittal in this report is designed to compliment the MD&A and should be read in conjunction with it.
