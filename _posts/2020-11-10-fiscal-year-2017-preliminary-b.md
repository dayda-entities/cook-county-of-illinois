Special Purpose Fund Outlook for Fiscal Year 2017. FY17 Ending Fund Balance Estimate calculated in accordance to FY17 Executive Expenditure Estimate. This data was released as part of the Fiscal Year 2017 Budget Preliminary Forecast. For more information see https://www.cookcountyil.gov/Budget

The Countyâ€™s Annual Appropriation Bill contains Special Purpose
Funds in addition to the General Fund, Health Fund and the Debt
Service Fund. Special Purpose Funds are established for a special
and dedicated purpose, and are considered to be self-balancing.
Self-balancing means that the appropriated revenues for each of
the special purpose funds supports the required expenditures for
the budgeted fiscal year.
